## The Device: ZEEQ Pillow, by REM-Fit

#### 1. Summary of data ownership

_What kind of data is this device collecting? What sensors are used? Where is the data being stored and who has ownership over the data? Is the data available to the user, and if so, in what format?_

##### Kind of data collected

-The following information comes from the website privacy policy (https://rem-fit.com/privacy-policy)
-The device collects: 
    -[A]n array of information about your activities will be generated through use of the device, including metrics regarding the number of steps taken, calories burned, amount of sleep and similar physical observations made possible by the device." 
-The app and company collect data on: 
  -"[N]ame, date of birth, height, weight, gender, user name and password, as well as choose one of the lifestyle types (such as active or sedentary)" 
  -"[Y]ou may enter other personal information such as personal goals, types of physical activity, and length of other physical activity"
  -The friends you interact with, if you elect to share your data with third party sites and apps (i.e. social media)
-Other data use:  
  -"We receive App Use Information either when you enter it directly into the App, or in the case of device-generated information, when you sync the device with the App."

-microphone â€“ to record sound, to monitor snoring
-gyroscope - to record movement, to approximate quality of sleep

##### Where the data is stored

-This is not clear based on the product description. REM-Fit insists they "do not sell or rent your personal data to non-affiliated third parties unless you have opted in to such sharing.  Other than as described in the previous sentence, we will not share your personal data with third parties without your permission, other than (i) as necessary or appropriate to carry out transactions you make on the Sites or Apps, (ii) comply with applicable law, court order or other judicial process, (iii) enforce or apply agreements with you, (iv) protect the rights, property, or safety of us, other users or third parties... or (vi) as otherwise required or permitted under applicable law." (Website privacy policy)
-"The Sites and Apps reside upon servers located in the United States of America." (Website privacy policy)
-Some data is stored locally on your phone in the ZEEQ app by REM-Fit

##### Who has ownership over your data

-This is also unclear. It appears that REM-Fit, owned by JAB Distributors (see below) stores and owns your data, yet will disclose some of it to third party contractors or marketers (in aggregate) (from Website Privacy Policy):
  -"In the unlikely event of a corporate transaction such as a sale or reorganization, or the bankruptcy or similar restructuring of JAB Distributors, LLC, *we reserve the right to disclose and/or transfer your personal data to potential buyer(s)* as part of such process.  Your personal data will not be sold or assigned separately from the goodwill of our company in such process."
  -"We may also hire contractors to provide certain services on our behalf, including analyses of our Sites and Apps, information processing and storage, and/or development of new products or services.  As part of their services to us, these contractors may have access to some or all of the data that we maintain, including your personal data, but they are required to maintain all data in confidence and to use the data only in order to provide services to us."
  -"[W]e are not restricted under this Privacy Policy from sharing aggregate data with third parties, including for marketing purposes.  While this aggregate data may have been derived from your personal information, the aggregate data will not contain information that may identify you individually, and as such, you will not be contacted by such third parties using such shared information."

##### Is your data available to you? If so, what format? 

-via the ZEEQ by REM-Fit app, for iOS or Android
-You can also set up to share data with Apple HealtKit

#### 2. How far can you trace the path of the data? How far can you trace the physical development of the device, its materials and manufacture? 

ZEEQ Pillow -> product of REM-Fit -> division of Protect-A-Bed North America LLC -> JAB Distributors, LLC

## The Replacement

#### Improvements

-Pillow senses when you get up in the morning
	-Sends a text message to your carpool-mates, to let them know you're on time
	-Tweet or social media posta bout what time you got up, so you can add it to your data on fitness (i.e. in addition to posting gym selfies, now you can brag about how much sleep you're getting or how little sleep you're able to get by on)
	-Starts your awesome IoT cofeee maker, or turns on your IoT plug that coffee maker is plugged into
  -Grabs information from bus schedule and tells you how many minutes you have until the next bus
-Customizable wake up alarms
  -Make custom vibration pulses, to indicate different times, days of the week, or events (e.g. class, doctor's appointment, etc.) that one is waking up for
  -Connect the motor to another person's phone, via the ZEEQ app, so that a third party (e.g. a parent) can tap the alarm to wake the pillow-owner up
